/*
We have a `media` mixin for make it easier to implement responsive styling via media queries.

You can nest them right within other blocks of CSS,which puts the properties and values you are changing right next
to each other.
That creates an obvious connection between them, which is a much nicer authoring experience than trying to maintain
those changes separated by tons of other code or in a different file.

## Usage

Here is how to use `media()` mixin:

.b-block {
    // styles outside of a media query

    @include media(sm) {
        // styles for "s" viewports
    };

    @include media(md-up) {
        // styles for "m" and "l" viewports
    };
}
*/


@mixin media($query) {
    $__query: null;

    @each $type in $query {
        @if map-has-key($media, $type) {
            $__query: append($__query, unquote(map-get($media, $type)), comma);
        } @else {
            @warn $type;
        }
    }

    @media #{$__query} {
        @content;
    }
}
